OEPL-Dash
=============

A small python application generating a dashboard with weather forecasts and a 2-day calendar and sending it to a predefined [OpenEPaperLink](https://github.com/OpenEPaperLink) Display.

# Todo:

- Better Readme (add image)
- make the code more generally applicable, less hard position definitions
- edit the calendar to be able to show more than two overlapping events (it currently breaks the layout a bit)
